### Description

An alginate based, heat-resistant and waterproof semi-transparent, matte foil

### Physical form

Surfaces

Color without additives: semi-transparent, white when layered

### Fabrication time

Preparation time: 1 hour (plus resting overnight)

Processing time: 5-7 days

Need attention: daily, to check if sheet needs to be taped down to stay in place on the mold

Final form achieved after: 7 days

## Ingredients

* **Sodium alginate powder - 12 gr**
	* the polymeer (so it becomes a solid)
* **Glycerine - 20 gr**
	* the plasticizer that bonds with the alginate (makes it flexible). 
* **Water - 400 ml/gr**
	* to dissolve and mix the polymeer and plasticizer
	* optional: use a (diluted) natural dye instead for a colored plastic
* **Sunflower oil - 10 gr**
	* filler to reduce shrinkage
* **Calcium chloride solution 10% (10 gr to 100 gr water)**
    * is the curing agent: calcium chloride attracts moisture very strongly: spraying it onto the alginate plastic starts the curing process. 

## Tools

1. **Scale**
1. **Spoon** 
1. **Blender** 
2. **Glass jar with lid**
3. **Spray bottle** (150 ml contents, for the calcium chloride solution)
2. **Acrylic sheet** smooth surface to cast the foil onto. A smooth surface will create a smooth matte foil.
3. **A strip of acrylic or squeeguee** to push the alginate mixture into place and form an even and flat rectangle
3. **Painting tape** to tape down if edges of the sheet start to come off of the surface
4. **Kitchen paper** to soak up the water that will be released from the alginate mixture

## Yield before processing/drying/curing

Approx. 200 ml of alginate plastic that can be stored for two weeks and used for any alginate application

Approx. 100 ml of calcium chloride 10% solution that can be used for any alginate recipe

## Method

1. **Preparation**
	- Weigh your ingredients for the alginate plastic (alginate, glycerine, water, sunflower oil). Optional: use a diluted natural dye instead of water in the same amount for a colored plastic.
	- Put the oil, alginate and glycerine in a blender and add a dash of the water. Blend into a thick and homogenous paste. Then add the rest of the water and blend again (this is to avoid lumps).
	- Leave the mixture overnight to allow the bubbles to come to the surface and pop.
	- Make the calcium chloride solution by dissolving 10 gr in 100 gr hot water. Put it in a spray bottle.

1. **Casting**
	- Prepare some space on an acrylic or glass surface 
	- Pour the alginate onto the acrylic sheet and use the squeeguee or acrylic strip to mold the liquid into a rectangular shape of about 3mm high
	- Spray the sheet with the calcium chloride solution (use quite a lot)
	- Let it sit for a few minutes, then spray again if you see the liquid is starting to ooze out from the sides. The film that is created in the curing process can break from the weight of the liquid bubble. By respraying you can close these until the sheet is cured enough and stable to dry further. 
	- The alginate can release quite a lot of water at this stage, so it's wise to place some kitchen paper around it to absorb excess water.

### Drying/curing/growth process

- Mold depth:  				N/A
- Shrinkage thickness:      20-30 %
- Shrinkage width/length:   10-20 %

**Shrinkage and deformation control**

Keep an eye on the sheet every few hours, especially on the first day. The thinner edges of the sheet might curl up when drying and pull of parts of the sheet. When it comes off it will start to warp. Taping it down onto the acrylic helps to keep it in place an dry in shape.
Let it dry up to seven days to get to the final form. When it no longer feels cool to the touch it is dry enough to take off. If you want to trim the edges do it while the foil is still a bit softer for a clean cut. 

**Curing agents and release agents**

Calcium chloride 10% as curing agent 

**Minimum wait time before releasing from mold**

3 days but ideally a week

**Post-processing**

trim the edges with scissors or a scalper and ruler if you wish

**Further research needed on drying/curing/growth?**

## Variations on this recipe

- Replace the water with a (diluted) **natural colorant** such as a vegetable dye or water-based ink (e.g. hibiscus, beetroot, madder) 
- Add **less glycerine** for a less flexible foil
- Take out the sunflower oil and use 30% less alginate to cast thinner foils
- You can also use this recipe to make composites such as the one described in the [alginate net recipe](https://class.textile-academy.org/2020/loes.bogers/files/recipes/alginatenet/)

### Cultural origins of this recipe

Alginate plastic is used a lot in molecular gastronomy, for (reverse) spherification that was patented by  William J. S. Peschardt in the 1940s and popularized in the molecular cuisine popularized by Adrian Ferra from restaurant El Bulli. Alginate plastics are also used a lot in molding and casting of dental technology industry.

Needs further research?:  not sure

Recycling this bioplastic with PET plastics contaminates the waste stream. Compost bioplastics in a warm environment with sufficient airflow.

## Material properties

### Comparative qualities

The foil has a feel that can be compared with a window foil (to blind windows but let the light through): it's matte but very translucent. It doesn't crackle or jump back like a lot of other foils.

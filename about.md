The learning community Critical Making and Research Through Design is an initiative of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. The learning community is a collaborative effort, supported by Amsterdam Fashion Institute and the lectorates Fashion Research Technology (Troy Nachtigall), Visual Methodologies (Sabine Niederer), and Play and Civic Media (Martijn de Waal) to connect research and education around this topic and these methodologies, together with local makers and creatives.
